I'm a computer science student with a huge genuine passion for software development and more than that. As someone with a true love for tech, I continuously push myself to learn more about programming and explore many other aspects of the tech field. I'm very interested in artifical intelligence, backend software, low-level software (especially operating systems), and computer networking, which is currently my biggest obsession along with low-level programming.
